@article{Hartwell1999,
abstract = {Cellular functions, such as signal transmission, are carried out by ‘modules' made up of many species of interacting molecules. Understanding how modules work has depended on combining phenomenological analysis with molecular studies. General principles that govern the structure and behaviour of modules may be discovered with help from synthetic sciences such as engineering and computer science, from stronger interactions between experiment and theory in cell biology, and from an appreciation of evolutionary constraints.},

@article{DiVentura2006,
abstract = {The massive acquisition of data in molecular and cellular biology has led to the renaissance of an old topic: simulations of biological systems. Simulations, increasingly paired with experiments, are being successfully and routinely used by computational biologists to understand and predict the quantitative behaviour of complex systems, and to drive new experiments. Nevertheless, many experimentalists still consider simulations an esoteric discipline only for initiates. Suspicion towards simulations should dissipate as the limitations and advantages of their application are better appreciated, opening the door to their permanent adoption in everyday research.},

@article{Fisher2007,
abstract = {Computational modeling of biological systems is becoming increasingly important in efforts to better understand complex biological behaviors. In this review, we distinguish between two types of biological models—mathematical and computational—which differ in their representations of biological phenomena. We call the approach of constructing computational models of biological systems 'executable biology', as it focuses on the design of executable computer algorithms that mimic biological phenomena. We survey the main modeling efforts in this direction, emphasize the applicability and benefits of executable models in biological research and highlight some of the challenges that executable biology poses for biology and computer science. We claim that for executable biology to reach its full potential as a mainstream biological technique, formal and algorithmic approaches must be integrated into biological research. This will drive biology toward a more precise engineering discipline.},
