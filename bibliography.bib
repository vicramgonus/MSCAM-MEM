@article{Folkman1973,
abstract = {Multi-cell spheroids were grown in soft agar. When each spheroid was cultured in a large volume of medium, frequently renewed, all spheroids eventually reached a dormant phase at a diameter of approximately 3-4 mm and a population of approximately 10(6) cells. In the dormant spheroid, newly generated cells at the periphery balanced those lost by necrosis in the center. We propose that this dormant phase is due to a gradual reduction in the ratio of surface area to volume: a size is achieved beyond which there is insufficient surface area for the spheroid to eliminate catabolites and absorb nutrients. Thus, in the face of unlimited space and of new medium, three-dimensional cell populations become self-regulating. This phenomenon contrasts with standard tissue culture in which cell populations, living on a flat plane in two dimensions, will not stop growing in the face of unlimited space and new medium because the ratio of surface area to volume remains constant. These experiments provide a mechanism for our observations in vivo: before vascularization, solid tumors live by simple diffusion as three-dimensional spheroids or ellipsoids. They become dormant at a diameter of only a few millimeters; once vascularized, they are released from this dormant phase and begin exponential growth. Thus, tumor dormancy resulting from absence of angiogenesis in vivo, may operate by the same mechanism responsible for dormancy of spheroids in vitro.},

abstract = {The structure and function of biological systems are considered to be closely  related. The present study addresses the question of how histological patterns of tumours are related to specific functional properties of the tumour cells. A mathematical model was developed, which facilitates the simulation of tumour growth and invasion by computer. The degree of cell division, migration and death can be interactively set and the simulation results can be observed on the screen. Additionally, these basic functional properties of a particular cell can be influenced by autocrine and paracrine factors. The study shows that the resulting morphological patterns closely depend on the preset functional properties of the tumour cells. Furthermore, each autocrine or paracrine factor, or combinations of these factors, induce peculiar modifications of the tumour pattern. These results provide evidence that histological tumour patterns reflect functional properties of the tumour cells and their interaction with the micro-environment. Qualitative and quantitative comparison of real tumour specimens with patterns simulated by computer may thus provide a logical base for a functional interpretation of static histological images.},

@article{Anderson1998,
abstract = {Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from a pre-existing vasculature, is a  process whereby capillary sprouts are formed in response to externally supplied chemical stimuli. The sprouts then grow and develop, driven initially by endothelial-cell migration, and organize themselves into a dendritic structure. Subsequent cell proliferation near the sprout tip permits further extension of the capillary and ultimately completes the process. Angiogenesis occurs during embryogenesis, wound healing, arthritis and during the growth of solid tumors. In this paper we present both continuous and discrete mathematical models which describe the formation of the capillary sprout network in response to chemical stimuli (tumor angiogenic factors, TAF) supplied by a solid tumor. The models also take into account essential endothelial cell-extracellular matrix interactions via the inclusion of the matrix macromolecule fibronectin. The continuous model consists of a system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the initial migratory response of endothelial cells to the TAF and the fibronectin. Numerical simulations of the system, using parameter values based on experimental data, are presented and compared qualitatively with in vivo experiments. We then use a discretized form of the partial differential equations to develop a biased random-walk model which enables us to track individual endothelial cells at the sprout tips and incorporate anastomosis, mitosis and branching explicitly into the model. The theoretical capillary networks generated by computer simulations of the discrete model are compared with the morphology of capillary networks observed in in vivo experiments.},

Our analysis concentrates on the stability of steady, radially-symmetric model solutions with respect to perturbations taken from the class of spherical harmonics. Using weakly nonlinear analysis, previous results are extended to show how the amplitudes of the asymmetric modes interact. Attention focuses on a special case for which the model equations simplify. Analysis of the simplified model equations leads to the identification of a two-parameter family of asymmetric steady solutions, the dimensions of whose stable and unstable manifolds depend on the system parameters. The asymmetric steady solutions limit the basin of attraction of the radially-symmetric steady state when it is linearly stable. On the basis of these numerical and analytical results we postulate the existence of fully nonlinear steady solutions which are stable with respect to time-dependent perturbations.},

The translation of genotype to phenotype is complicated by gene interactions observed as epistasis, canalization, robustness, or buffering. Analysis of double mutations in inbred experimental organisms suggests some principles for gene interaction that may apply to natural variation as well. The buffering of variation in one gene is most often due to a small number of other genes that function in the same biochemical process. However, buffering can also result from genes functioning in processes extrinsic to that of the primary gene.},

abstract = {Most species maintain abundant genetic variation and experience a range of environmental conditions, yet phenotypic variation is low. That is, development is robust to changes in genotype and environment. It has been claimed that this robustness, termed canalization, evolves because of long-term natural selection for optimal phenotypes. We show that the developmental process, here modeled as a network of interacting transcriptional regulators, constrains the genetic system to produce canalization, even without selection toward an optimum. The extent of canalization, measured as the insensitivity to mutation of a network's equilibrium state, depends on the complexity of the network, such that more highly connected networks evolve to be more canalized. We argue that canalization may be an inevitable consequence of complex developmental–genetic processes and thus requires no explanation in terms of evolution to suppress phenotypic variation.},

By varying three treatment parameters, we can simulate tumors that display clinically plausible survival times. Much of our work is dedicated to heterogeneous tumors with both treatment-sensitive and treatment-resistant cells. First, we investigate two-strain systems in which resistant cells are initialized within predominantly sensitive tumors. We find that when resistant cells are not confined to a particular location, they compete more effectively with the sensitive population. Moreover, in this case, the fraction of resistant cells within the tumor is a less important indicator of patient prognosis when compared to the case in which the resistant cells are scattered throughout the tumor. In additional simulations, we investigate tumors that are initially monoclonal and treatment-sensitive, but that undergo resistance-mutations in response to treatment. Here, the tumors with both very frequent and very infrequent mutations develop with more spherical geometries. Tumors with intermediate mutational responses exhibit multi-lobed geometries, as mutant strains develop at localized points on the tumors' surfaces.},

abstract = {The available mathematical models describing tumor growth and the effect of anticancer treatments on tumors in animals are of limited use within the drug industry. A simple and effective model would allow applying quantitative thinking to the preclinical development of oncology drugs. In this article, a minimal pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model is presented, based on a system of ordinary differential equations that link the dosing regimen of a compound to the tumor growth in animal models. The growth of tumors in nontreated animals is described by an exponential growth followed by a linear growth. In treated animals, the tumor growth rate is decreased by a factor proportional to both drug concentration and number of proliferating tumor cells. A transit compartmental system is used to model the process of cell death, which occurs at later times. The parameters of the pharmacodynamic model are related to the growth characteristics of the tumor, to the drug potency, and to the kinetics of the tumor cell death. Therefore, such parameters can be used for ranking compounds based on their potency and for evaluating potential differences in the tumor cell death process. The model was extensively tested on discovery candidates and known anticancer drugs. It fitted well the experimental data, providing reliable parameter estimates. On the basis of the parameters estimated in a first experiment, the model successfully predicted the response of tumors exposed to drugs given at different dose levels and/or schedules. It is, thus, possible to use the model prospectively, optimizing the design of new experiments.},

@article{Marcu2005,
abstract = {Although chemotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of haematological tumours, in many common solid tumours the success has been limited. Some of the reasons for the limitations are: the timing of drug delivery, resistance to the drug, repopulation between cycles of chemotherapy and the lack of complete understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a specific agent. Cisplatin is among the most effective cytotoxic agents used in head and neck cancer treatments. When modelling cisplatin as a single agent, the properties of cisplatin only have to be taken into account, reducing the number of assumptions that are considered in the generalized chemotherapy models. The aim of the present paper is to model the biological effect of cisplatin and to simulate the consequence of cisplatin resistance on tumour control. The 'treated' tumour is a squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, previously grown by computer-based Monte Carlo techniques. The model maintained the biological constitution of a tumour through the generation of stem cells, proliferating cells and non-proliferating cells. Cell kinetic parameters (mean cell cycle time, cell loss factor, thymidine labelling index) were also consistent with the literature. A sensitivity study on the contribution of various mechanisms leading to drug resistance is undertaken. To quantify the extent of drug resistance, the cisplatin resistance factor (CRF) is defined as the ratio between the number of surviving cells of the resistant population and the number of surviving cells of the sensitive population, determined after the same treatment time. It is shown that there is a supra-linear dependence of CRF on the percentage of cisplatin-DNA adducts formed, and a sigmoid-like dependence between CRF and the percentage of cells killed in resistant tumours. Drug resistance is shown to be a cumulative process which eventually can overcome tumour regression leading to treatment failure. {\textcopyright} 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Mathematical models of tumor-immune interactions provide an analytic framework in which to address specific questions about tumor-immune dynamics. We present a new mathematical model that describes tumor-immune interactions, focusing on the role of natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells in tumor surveillance, with the goal of understanding the dynamics of immune-mediated tumor rejection. The model describes tumor-immune cell interactions using a system of differential equations. The functions describing tumor-immune growth, response, and interaction rates, as well as associated variables, are developed using a least-squares method combined with a numerical differential equations solver. Parameter estimates and model validations use data from published mouse and human studies. Specifically, CD8+ T-tumor and NK-tumor lysis data from chromium release assays as well as in vivo tumor growth data are used. A variable sensitivity analysis is done on the model. The new functional forms developed show that there is a clear distinction between the dynamics of NK and CD8+ T cells. Simulations of tumor growth using different levels of immune stimulating ligands, effector cells, and tumor challenge are able to reproduce data from the published studies. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the variable to which the model is most sensitive is patient specific, and can be measured with a chromium release assay. The variable sensitivity analysis suggests that the model can predict which patients may positively respond to treatment. Computer simulations highlight the importance of CD8+ T-cell activation in cancer therapy.},

Understanding the origins, growth and spread of cancer, therefore requires an integrated or system-wide approach. Computational systems biology is an emerging sub-discipline in systems biology that utilizes the wealth of data from genomic, proteomic and metabolomic studies to build computer simulations of intra and intercellular processes. Several useful descriptive and predictive models of the origin, growth and spread of cancers have been developed in an effort to better understand the disease and potential therapeutic approaches. In this review we describe and assess the practical and theoretical underpinnings of commonly-used modeling approaches, including ordinary and partial differential equations, petri nets, cellular automata, agent based models and hybrid systems. A number of computer-based formalisms have been implemented to improve the accessibility of the various approaches to researchers whose primary interest lies outside of model development. We discuss several of these and describe how they have led to novel insights into tumor genesis, growth, apoptosis, vascularization and therapy.},

abstract = {Malignant melanoma is a cancer of the skin arising in the melanocytes. We present a mathematical model of melanoma invasion into healthy tissue with an immune response. We use this model as a framework with which to investigate primary tumor invasion and treatment by surgical excision. We observe that the presence of immune cells can destroy tumors, hold them to minimal expansion, or, through the production of angiogenic factors, induce tumorigenic expansion. We also find that the tumor–immune system dynamic is critically important in determining the likelihood and extent of tumor regrowth following resection. We find that small metastatic lesions distal to the primary tumor mass can be held to a minimal size via the immune interaction with the larger primary tumor. Numerical experiments further suggest that metastatic disease is optimally suppressed by immune activation when the primary tumor is moderately, rather than minimally, metastatic. Furthermore, satellite lesions can become aggressively tumorigenic upon removal of the primary tumor and its associated immune tissue. This can lead to recurrence where total cancer mass increases more quickly than in primary tumor invasion, representing a clinically more dangerous disease state. These results are in line with clinical case studies involving resection of a primary melanoma followed by recurrence in local metastases.},

As the effect of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy on tumour cells is the same (attack on cancer cells), the response of the tumour to injury and cell loss from the two treatment methods should be similar, including repopulation. Cell recruitment is known to be a possible mechanism responsible for tumour regrowth after radiotherapy. The literature data regarding mechanisms of repopulation after chemotherapy is very limited. The current paper employs a Monte Carlo modelling approach to implement the pharmacokinetics of a widely used drug (cisplatin) into a previously developed virtual head and neck tumour and to study the effect of cisplatin on tumour regression and regrowth during treatment. The mechanism of cell recruitment was modelled by releasing various percentages (5-50\%) of quiescent cells into the mitotic cycle after each chemotherapy cell kill. The onset of repopulation was also simulated, with both immediate onset and late onset of cell recruitment. Repopulation during chemotherapy, if occurring, is a highly potent phenomenon, similar to drug resistance, therefore it should not be neglected during treatment.},

Hybrid models provide a way to integrate both discrete and continuous variables that are used to represent individual cells and concentration or density fields, respectively. Each discrete cell can also be equipped with submodels that drive cell behavior in response to microenvironmental cues. Moreover, the individual cells can interact with one another to form and act as an integrated tissue. Hybrid models form part of a larger class of individual-based models that can naturally connect with tumor cell biology and allow for the integration of multiple interacting variables both intrinsically and extrinsically and are therefore perfectly suited to a systems biology approach to tumor growth.},

abstract = {The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in cancer development, progression, and control. The molecular and cellular nature of the tumor immune microenvironment influences disease outcome by altering the balance of suppressive versus cytotoxic responses in the vicinity of the tumor. Recent developments in systems biology have improved our understanding of the complex interactions between tumors and their immunological microenvironment in various human cancers. Effective tumor surveillance by the host immune system protects against disease, but chronic inflammation and tumor "immunoediting" have also been implicated in disease development and progression. Accordingly, reactivation and maintenance of appropriate antitumor responses within the tumor microenvironment correlate with a good prognosis in cancer patients. Improved understanding of the factors that shape the tumor microenvironment will be critical for the development of effective future strategies for disease management. The manipulation of these microenvironmental factors is already emerging as a promising tool for novel cancer treatments. In this paper, we summarize the various roles of the tumor microenvironment in cancer, focusing on immunological mediators of tumor progression and control, as well as the significant challenges for future therapies.},

abstract = {Background: Recently, melanoma has become the most malignant and commonly occurring skin cancer. Melanoma is not only the major source (75\%) of deaths related to skin cancer, but also it is hard to be treated by the conventional drugs. Recent research indicated that angiogenesis is an important factor for tumor initiation, expansion, and response to therapy. Thus, we proposed a novel multi-scale agent-based computational model that integrates the angiogenesis into tumor growth to study the response of melanoma cancer under combined drug treatment. Results: Our multi-scale agent-based model can simulate the melanoma tumor growth with angiogenesis under combined drug treatment. The significant synergistic effects between drug Dox and drug Sunitinib demonstrated the clinical potential to interrupt the communication between melanoma cells and its related vasculatures. Also, the sensitivity analysis of the model revealed that diffusivity related to the micro-vasculatures around tumor tissues closely correlated with the spread, oscillation and destruction of the tumor. Conclusions: Simulation results showed that the 3D model can represent key features of melanoma growth, angiogenesis, and its related micro-environment. The model can help cancer researchers understand the melanoma developmental mechanism. Drug synergism analysis suggested that interrupting the communications between melanoma cells and the related vasculatures can significantly increase the drug efficacy against tumor cells. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {For progressive prostate cancer, intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) is one of the most common and effective treatments. Although this treatment is usually initially effective at regressing tumors, most patients eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), for which there is no effective treatment and is generally fatal. Although several biologic mechanisms leading to CRPC development and their relative frequencies have been identified, it is difficult to determine which mechanisms of resistance are developing in a given patient. Personalized therapy that identifies and targets specific mechanisms of resistance developing in individual patients is likely one of the most promising methods of future cancer therapy. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a biomarker for monitoring tumor progression. We incorporated a cell death rate (CDR) function into a previous dynamical PSA model that was highly accurate at fitting clinical PSA data for 7 patients. The mechanism of action of IAD is largely induction of apoptosis, and each mechanism of resistance varies in its CDR dynamics. Thus, we analyze the CDR levels and their time-dependent oscillations to identify mechanisms of resistance to IAD developing in individual patients.

abstract = {Until recently, the intrinsically high level of cross-talk between immune cells, the complexity of immune cell development, and the pleiotropic nature of cytokine signaling have hampered progress in understanding the mechanisms of immunosuppression by which tumor cells circumvent native and adaptive immune responses. One technology that has helped to shed light on this complex signaling network is the cytokine antibody array, which facilitates simultaneous screening of dozens to hundreds of secreted signal proteins in complex biological samples. The combined applications of traditional methods of molecular and cell biology with the high-content, high-throughput screening capabilities of cytokine antibody arrays and other multiplexed immunoassays have revealed a complex mechanism that involves multiple cytokine signals contributed not just by tumor cells but by stromal cells and a wide spectrum of immune cell types. This review will summarize the interactions among cancerous and immune cell types, as well as the key cytokine signals that are required for tumors to survive immunoediting in a dormant state or to grow and spread by escaping it. Additionally, it will present examples of how probing secreted cell-cell signal networks in the tumor microenvironment (TME) with cytokine screens have contributed to our current understanding of these processes and discuss the implications of this understanding to antitumor therapies. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

This Review discusses the growing evidence that cooperative behaviour of tumour subclones can influence disease progression. Although it is widely accepted that most cancers exhibit some degree of intratumour heterogeneity, we are far from understanding the dynamics that operate among subpopulations within tumours. There is growing evidence that cancer cells behave as communities, and increasing attention is now being directed towards the cooperative behaviour of subclones that can influence disease progression. As expected, these interactions can add a greater layer of complexity to therapeutic interventions in heterogeneous tumours, often leading to a poor prognosis. In this Review, we highlight studies that demonstrate such interactions in cancer and postulate ways to overcome them with better-designed therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Histopathologic knowledge that extensive heterogeneity exists between and within tumors has been confirmed and deepened recently by molecular studies. However, the impact of tumor heterogeneity on prognosis and treatment remains as poorly understood as ever. Using a hybrid multiscale mathematical model of tumor growth in vascularized tissue, we investigated the selection pressures exerted by spatial and temporal variations in tumor microenvironment and the resulting phenotypic adaptations. A key component of this model is normal and tumor metabolism and its interaction with microenvironmental factors. The metabolic phenotype of tumor cells is plastic, and microenvironmental selection leads to increased tumor glycolysis and decreased pH. Once this phenotype emerges, the tumor dramatically changes its behavior due to acid-mediated invasion, an effect that depends on both variations in the tumor cell phenotypes and their spatial distribution within the tumor. In early stages of growth, tumors are stratified, with the most aggressive cells developing within the interior of the tumor. These cells then grow to the edge of the tumor and invade into the normal tissue using acidosis. Simulations suggest that diffusible cytotoxic treatments, such as chemotherapy, may increase the metabolic aggressiveness of a tumor due to drug-mediated selection. Chemotherapy removes the metabolic stratification of the tumor and allows more aggressive cells to grow toward blood vessels and normal tissue. Antiangiogenic therapy also selects for aggressive phenotypes due to degradation of the tumor microenvironment, ultimately resulting in a more invasive tumor. In contrast, pH buffer therapy slows down the development of aggressive tumors, but only if administered when the tumor is still stratified. Overall, findings from this model highlight the risks of cytotoxic and antiangiogenic treatments in the context of tumor heterogeneity resulting from a selection for more aggressive behaviors.},

@article{Sun2016,
abstract = {Several reports suggest that the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy on survival diminishes over time for colon cancer; however, precise timing of its loss of benefit has not been established. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the relationship between time to adjuvant chemotherapy and survival and to identify a threshold for increased risk of mortality. DESIGN: This was a retrospective study. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling with restricted cubic splines was used to evaluate the adjusted association between time to adjuvant chemotherapy and overall survival and to establish an optimal threshold for the initiation of therapy. SETTINGS: Data were collected from the National Cancer Data Base. PATIENTS: Adults who received adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of stage II to III colon cancers were selected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 7794 patients were included. After adjusting for clinical, tumor, and treatment characteristics, our model determined a critical threshold of chemotherapy initiation at 44 days from surgery, after which there was an increase in the overall mortality. At a median follow-up of 61 months, the risk of mortality was increased in those who received adjuvant chemotherapy after 44 days from surgery (adjusted HR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.24; p = 0.002), but not in those who received chemotherapy before 44 days from surgery (p = 0.11). Each additional week of delay was associated with a 7\% decrease in survival (HR, 1.07; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.10; p < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by selection bias and the inability to compare specific chemotherapy regimens. CONCLUSIONS: This study objectively determines the optimal timing of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with resected colon cancer. Delay beyond 6 weeks is associated with compromised survival. These findings emphasize the importance of the timely initiation of therapy, and suggest that efforts to enhance recovery following surgery have the potential to improve survival by decreasing delay to adjuvant chemotherapy.},

The insights gain in the proposed work to model the immune-tumor interaction is of great importance to control the tumor growth via micro-environment factors. The parameters used in the present model are in compatible with cancer biology using in vivo experimental data. The results show that the proposed model not only is able to simulate the tumor growth graphically, but also the in vivo tumor growth quantitatively and qualitatively. In this paper, by introducing a new concept; critical point, a new idea is proposed to shrink the tumor or slow down its growth rate. The tumor will grow slowly if the division probability of the proliferative tumor cells depends on the microenvironmental conditions.

abstract = {Abstract The number of cancer survivors continues to increase in the United States because of the growth and aging of the population as well as advances in early detection and treatment. To assist the public health community in better serving these individuals, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute collaborate every 3 years to estimate cancer prevalence in the United States using incidence and survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries; vital statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics; and population projections from the US Census Bureau. Current treatment patterns based on information in the National Cancer Data Base are presented for the most prevalent cancer types. Cancer-related and treatment-related short-term, long-term, and late health effects are also briefly described. More than 16.9 million Americans (8.1 million males and 8.8 million females) with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2019; this number is projected to reach more than 22.1 million by January 1, 2030 based on the growth and aging of the population alone. The 3 most prevalent cancers in 2019 are prostate (3,650,030), colon and rectum (776,120), and melanoma of the skin (684,470) among males, and breast (3,861,520), uterine corpus (807,860), and colon and rectum (768,650) among females. More than one-half (56\%) of survivors were diagnosed within the past 10 years, and almost two-thirds (64\%) are aged 65 years or older. People with a history of cancer have unique medical and psychosocial needs that require proactive assessment and management by follow-up care providers. Although there are growing numbers of tools that can assist patients, caregivers, and clinicians in navigating the various phases of cancer survivorship, further evidence-based resources are needed to optimize care.},

In this study, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of treatment-na{\"{i}}ve TNBC and serial biopsies from TNBC patients undergoing NACT were used to elucidate mechanisms of chemoresistance in the neoadjuvant setting. Barcode-mediated clonal tracking and genomic sequencing of PDX tumors revealed that residual tumors remaining after treatment with standard frontline chemotherapies, doxorubicin (Adriamycin) combined with cyclophosphamide (AC), maintained the subclonal architecture of untreated tumors, yet their transcriptomes, proteomes, and histologic features were distinct from those of untreated tumors. Once treatment was halted, residual tumors gave rise to AC-sensitive tumors with similar transcriptomes, proteomes, and histological features to those of untreated tumors. Together, these results demonstrated that tumors can adopt a reversible drug-tolerant state that does not involve clonal selection as an AC resistance mechanism. Serial biopsies obtained from patients with TNBC undergoing NACT revealed similar histologic changes and maintenance of stable subclonal architecture, demonstrating that AC-treated PDXs capture molecular features characteristic of human TNBC chemoresistance. Last, pharmacologic inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation using an inhibitor currently in phase 1 clinical development delayed residual tumor regrowth. Thus, AC resistance in treatment-na{\"{i}}ve TNBC can be mediated by nonselective mechanisms that confer a reversible chemotherapy-tolerant state with targetable vulnerabilities.},

The results of the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-0213 study were recently published, which showed no advantage in terms of overall survival (OS) in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian undergoing secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCS) compared to chemotherapy alone. Aim of this narrative review is to summarize the best aspects that can make ovarian cancer recurrence patients suitable for SCS. A narrative review analyzing all the literature of the past 30 years has been performed. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Ovid MEDLINE were used for research. All non-English-language articles have been excluded. The following keywords were searched: 'recurrent ovarian cancer', 'secondary surgery', 'secondary cytoreductive surgery', 'platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer', 'platinum-resistant ovarian cancer'. We divided eligible patients for secondary cytoreduction in relation to the following factors: platinum-sensitivity, AGO-score or Tian model, unresectable lesions, surgical generic contraindication, woman's personal choice. The selection of truly suitable patients for surgery seems an essential requirement for the patient's best therapeutic choice. In case of absent post-surgical residual tumor, good performance status, single recurrence, and platinum-sensitive ovarian recurrence, surgery could be performed.},
